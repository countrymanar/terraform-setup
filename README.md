# oracle-cloud-iaas-workshop

## This will deploy two virtual machines configured with MEAN STACK and Load Balanced on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using Terraform

# Software Requirements

To run this you must have installed the Terraform binary (at least 0.9.x) and configured it per instruction.

You must also have installed the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Terraform provider.

You will also, of course, need access to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account. If you do not have access, you can request a free trial. To learn more about Oracle OCI, read the Getting Started guide.

# Environment Requirements

If you are following along with the workshop Terraform can be installed from install_terraform.sh.
